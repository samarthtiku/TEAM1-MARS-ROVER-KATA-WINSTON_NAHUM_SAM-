## üåü Project Overview
Our Mars Rover Project( # üöÄ Team 1 Mars Rover Simulation (Winston , Nahum , Samarth )) is an advanced implementation of the classic Thoughtworks Mars Rover problem. Our team has taken the original challenge and significantly expanded it, creating a robust and feature-rich simulation that exceeds the basic requirements.

## üéØ Original Thoughtworks Problem
As described by [danilsuits](https://danilsuits.github.io/mars-rover-kata/):

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

A rover's position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

### Input:
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.

The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau. The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.

Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover won't start to move until the first one has finished moving.

### Output:
The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.

### Example:
Test Input:
```
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
```

Expected Output:
```
1 3 N
5 1 E
```

## üöÄ Our Approach and Enhancements
We've elevated the original concept by incorporating:

1. **Multiple Rover Types**: Introducing standard and jumping rovers, each with unique capabilities.
2. **Advanced Collision Detection**: Ensuring rovers don't occupy the same space.
3. **Enhanced Console Visualization**: Rich, colorful representation of the plateau and rover positions using ANSI escape codes.
4. **Extended Command Set**: Implementing additional commands beyond the basic move and rotate, including support for jumping rovers.
5. **Distance Tracking**: Calculating and reporting the total distance traveled by each rover.
6. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation and error reporting, including out-of-bounds movement prevention.
7. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to easily accommodate new rover types or commands.
8. **Interactive Command Input**: Allowing users to input commands for each rover sequentially.
9. **Informative Console Output**: Providing clear feedback on rover movements, including successful moves and warnings for invalid actions.

### Key Enhancements and Extra Credit Features(OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS: https://github.com/samarthtiku/TEAM1-MARS-ROVER-KATA-WINSTON_NAHUM_SAM-/blob/seventh-Branch/MARSROVER_TEAM1_OUTPUT.pdf)

1. **Multiple Rover Types**: We introduced both standard and jumping rovers, adding complexity to the simulation.
2. **Advanced Movement Commands**: In addition to the basic L, R, and M commands, we implemented a J command for jumping rovers.
3. **Collision Detection**: Our simulation prevents rovers from occupying the same position, adding realism to the scenario.
4. **Distance Tracking**: We calculate and report the total distance traveled by each rover, providing valuable metrics.
5. **Enhanced Visualization with ANSI Escape Codes**: We implemented a visually rich console interface using ANSI escape codes. This feature includes:
   - Color-coded representation of different rover types
   - Dynamic updating of the plateau state
   - Visually distinct representations for rover orientations (e.g., ‚Üë, ‚Üí, ‚Üì, ‚Üê)
   - Highlighted feedback for successful moves and error states
6. **Improved Usability**: We focused on creating clear console output and an intuitive command input interface for a better user experience, leveraging the ANSI escape codes for enhanced readability.

## üß† Concepts and Design Patterns

Our Mars Rover Simulation project incorporates a wide range of software engineering concepts and design patterns:

### üèóÔ∏è Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
1. **Encapsulation**: Used in classes like `Plateau` and `AbstractRover`.
2. **Inheritance**: Rover hierarchy with `AbstractRover` as the base class.
3. **Polymorphism**: Different rover types can be used interchangeably.
4. **Abstraction**: `AbstractRover` provides a common interface for all rover types.

## üé® Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: 
  - Implemented in `RoverFactory` and `RoverFactoryImpl`.
  - Centralizes the creation of different types of rovers (e.g., `StandardRover`, `JumpingRover`).
  - Ensures flexibility for adding new rover types without modifying existing code, following the **Open/Closed Principle**.

- **Command Pattern**: 
  - Used to implement rover movement commands (`L`, `R`, `M`) as separate objects.
  - Encapsulates each command, making it easy to manage command sequences and extend with new commands.
  - Facilitates future enhancements like undo/redo functionality.

- **Strategy Pattern**: 
  - Handles different movement algorithms for various rover types.
  - For example, `StandardMovementStrategy` for standard rovers and `JumpingMovementStrategy` for jumping rovers.
  - Simplifies the `Rover` class by delegating movement behavior, making it easy to add new strategies.

- **Singleton Pattern**: 
  - Used for `PlateauConfiguration` to ensure only one instance of the plateau configuration exists.
  - Prevents inconsistent or conflicting settings across the application and optimizes memory usage.

- **Memento Pattern**: 
  - Enables undo/redo functionality by storing snapshots of rover states at specific points in time.
  - Encapsulates the rover's internal state without exposing it, enhancing user experience for error recovery.

- **Observer Pattern**: 
  - Allows real-time monitoring of rover status changes during simulation.
  - Decouples rover movement logic from the rest of the system, making it easy to add new components like a visualization module or logging.

- **Iterator Pattern**: 
  - Processes sequences of rover movement commands in a standardized way.
  - Separates command traversal from the underlying command representation, ensuring clean and efficient command execution.


### üß± SOLID Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a well-defined purpose.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: System is open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subclasses can be used interchangeably with base class.
4. **Interface Segregation**: Use of focused interfaces like `InputHandler`.
5. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions.

### üí° Other Programming Concepts
1. **Enums**: Used for `Orientation` (N, E, S, W).
2. **Exception Handling**: Implemented for invalid inputs and out-of-bounds movements.
3. **Immutability**: `Plateau` class designed as immutable for thread safety.

### üõ†Ô∏è Software Engineering Practices
1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Used throughout the development process.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Implemented using GitHub Actions.
3. **Version Control**: Git used for source code management.

### üìä Data Structures and Algorithms
1. **2D Grid**: Used in `Plateau` to represent the Mars surface.
2. **Lists and Maps**: Used for managing rovers and their positions.
3. **Grid Navigation Algorithms**: For moving rovers and collision detection.

### üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Concepts
1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: For user input and output.
2. **ANSI Escape Codes**: For colorful and formatted console output.
